Contributing to Truchas
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We welcome contributions of code and documentation to the Truchas project.
To clearly define the terms under which the intellectual property has been
contributed, we require all non-LANL contributors to submit an [Individual
Contributor License Agreement][ICLA] (ICLA). This will allow us to defend
the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some
future time.

A [Corporate CLA][CCLA] (CCLA) is also required from organizations to cover
intellectual property contributions made by their employees that may have been
assigned to the organization as part of an employment agreement.  Note that a
Corporate CLA does not remove the need for every individual to sign their own
ICLA to cover any of their contributions not owned by the organization.
 
The ICLA is not tied to any employer you may have, so it is recommended to use
one's personal email address in the contact details.

#### Submitting a Contributor License Agreement
A scan of the completed and signed agreement should be emailed as a pdf file
to <truchas@lanl.gov>.  The project will then forward it to the address given
in the agreement on your behalf.
