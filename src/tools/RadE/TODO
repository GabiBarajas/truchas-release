THINGS THAT OUGHT TO BE DONE
----------------------------
* Include enclosure name in the radiation enclosure dataset.
* Implement a mod to the Chaparral library that results in progress
  messages with a time stamp being written during the VF calc.
  This will help us gauge how much time will be required for a full run.
* The methods in re_graphics_gmv.F90 are still serial.  Think about
  making them parallel, in the sense they only do stuff from process rank 1.
  This would make it consist with the other modules.
* Review the get col/row methods from re_dist_vf_type.F90.
* Finish documenting all the modules.
* Write some end-user documentation for the programs.


Reorganizations
---------------
* The vizre_command_line module contains some generic code for splitting
  strings on a character.  Consider moving this to the string_utilities
  module in the Truchas tree.  Also there is code for parsing Fortran-style
  range strings (like 1:13:2) to generate integer lists.  This would be
  generally useful, and maybe it ought to be moved into the input_utilities
  module in the Truchas tree.
