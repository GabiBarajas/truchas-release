TEST 3: HYBRID HEX/WEDGE MESH
-----------------------------

We have limited ability to generate truly hybrid meshes that contain
(connected) combinations of hexes, tets, and wedges.  Cubit is only
able to generate pure hex or tet meshes in each connected component
of the mesh.  The mesh utility cyl2car is able, however, to take a
hex mesh with cylindrical coordinate data (r,theta,z) and transform
it into a cartesian coordinate mesh.  In the process some hex elements
are transformed into wedge elements.  Mesh3.exo is such a mesh (the
source cylindrical coordinate mesh is mesh3-cyl.exo).  The element
blocks are pictured in mesh3-blocks-front.png and mesh-blocks-back.png.
The gap side sets 11-15 are pictured in mesh3-sidesets.png.  There are
external boundary side sets 20 and 30, also.  Each of the side sets
11-15 intersect both wedge and hex element blocks, and they contain
both tri and quad sides of wedge elements.
