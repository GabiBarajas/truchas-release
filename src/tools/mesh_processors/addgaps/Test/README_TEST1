TEST 1: HEX MESHES
-----------------

Mesh1 Characteristics
o 343 nodes, 216 hexes
o Side sets.  See mesh1-sidesets.png
  - 10, 20, 30, 40 are single-sided (forward)
  - 21 defines the same surface as 20 but is two-sided (forward/reverse)
  - 22 is the front half of 20 (21), and is single-sided (reverse)
  - 10, 22, 30, 40 each contain 18 sides
  - 20 contains 36 sides, and 21 contains 72 sides.
o Node sets.
  - 1 has 7 nodes; intersects side sets 10, 20, 21, 22, 40
  - 2 has 7 nodes; not involved with any side set.
