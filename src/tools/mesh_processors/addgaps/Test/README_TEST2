TEST 2: TET MESHES
------------------

Mesh2 Characteristics
o 92 nodes, 239 tets
o Side sets; see mesh2-sidesets.png
  - 10, 20, 30, 40 are single-sided (forward)
  - 21 defines the same surface as 20 but is two-sided (forward/reverse)
  - 22 is the front half of 20 (21), and is single-sided (reverse)
  - 10 has 14 sides, 20 has 24, 21 has 48, and 22, 30, 40 each have 12 sides
o Node sets.
  - 1 has 5 nodes; intersects side sets 10, 20, 21, 22, 40
  - 2 has 5 nodes; not involved with any side set.
