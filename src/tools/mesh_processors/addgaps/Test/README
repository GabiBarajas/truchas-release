This directory contains some small tests to verify the correct function
of the utility program addgaps.  There are three test meshes.  The first
two are a cube divided into 3 bodies with a collection of internal side
sets, and node sets defined.  Mesh1 is meshed with hexes, and mesh2 with
tets.  The bulk of the testing can be performed with these meshes.  Mesh3
is a hybrid mesh containing both hex and wedge elements and is used to
test the ability of addgaps to correctly handle hybrid meshes with both
tri and quad sides on the gap surfaces.

See the README_TEST* files for a description of the tests in each suite,
and the expected results.  Reference output from the tests can be found
in the subdirectory Reference_Output.

For the hex mesh tests (TEST1) we can read the output meshes back into
cubit for visualization to verify the results.  The output of the
remaining tests will contain wedge elements and cubit will not import
these, however.  Ensight8 is able to read Exodus meshes and can be used
for visualization.

The netCDF utility 'ncdump' can be used to obtain a human-readable dump
of the .exo files in order to verify quantitatively that addgaps is
functioning correctly.  Unless the mesh is very small, this is most
useful only for checking the number of nodes and elements, the number
of new element blocks and their type, the number of sides in each side
set, etc.
