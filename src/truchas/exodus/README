The EXODUS module provides procedures for reading and writing Exodus II
mesh files, and derived types that encapsulate the mesh data.  This is
a standalone module, depending only the NETCDF module that is part of
the netCDF distribution.

Application code only needs to use module EXODUS; the remaining modules
should be considered private modules.  Consult the programming guide in
the Doc directory for instructions on its use.

Some test code is found in the directory Test.

The directory Doc contains the programming guide and some additional
documentation on the Exodus II format which may be useful in further
development of this package.

The module string_utilities is itself a standalone module containing
some basic character string utilities.  In the future it should be
moved to another directory for general use, but for now we leave it here.
