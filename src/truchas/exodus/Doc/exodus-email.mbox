The changes were described in a email message I sent out last fall.  I've
attached it to this email also.  Note that in addition to the exodusII
changes, there is a modified netcdf library that is needed also; the default
unidata version won't work until their next release.  

I'm not sure if you sent the original request to me, but I am the current
maintainer of exodusII.

Neil,
I've sent your request on to someone who might have a better answer than
I 
do, but haven't received a response.

Anyway, the exodus format, by default, hasn't changed any.  So, doing a 
normal mesh and exporting it should work fine.  

When you set the large exodus flag on, it should change the output of
the 
file slightly.  Normally, the x, y, z coordinates are written as
triplets:

1.0000 2.000 3.000

and so on.

With the large model support, the coordinates are broken up, so that the

x-coords are all written first, then the y-coords are all written, and 
then the z-coords.  This allows the individual sections to be larger 
(memory-wise), and the exodus standard to support a greater number of 
elements.

I don't know that there's a current document about this, but I'll ping
our 
expert again.

Greg,

Thanks for the information; it's very helpful.  There are still
a few things I have questions about.

o Using ncdump on a cubit-generated exodus file shows variables
  eb_status, ss_status, and ns_status.  Are these cubit-specific
  data arrays, or are they defined by the ExodusII standard?
  They appear in both API version 3 and 4 files, but I don't see
  anything in the existing Exodus documentation that these arrays
  might correspond to.

They are not exposed via the API, but are just internal variables that
determine whether the entity is active (has >0 nodes/elements).  The
variables were added when we started doing parallel runs since there would
be blocks/sidesets/nodesets on particular processors that didn't have any
elements/nodes in them.

o I'm troubled that a customized netCDF library, that we do not
  have access to, is being used.  I'm using the publicly available
  library (3.5.1) to directly access the data in the netcdf file.
  When can this be expected to work with your exodus files?  Is it
  *only* when large-file support is enabled that it will break, or
  do your changes effect other things as well?

ExodusII has always used a nonstandard version of the netcdf library.  We
increase several of the dimensions over the standard-distributed version.
Exodus always required that you used our special version instead of the
default and this is no difference. As far as I know, if you can get
exodusII, you can get our changes to netcdf. The changes I made to netcdf
have been given back to the unidata team and they are releasing it in
version 3.6; the changes are already incorporated in parallel-netcdf.  Other
than the dimension changes, the default library should work unless large
file support is active.

o When netcdf 3.6 goes live (I see it's still beta) will you move
  back to it, or still maintain your own customized version?

We will make our changes to the dimensions and the changes to support
improved IO on the janus sytem.  There may also be some local changes to
support IO on the new reddish/red storm system.

--Greg

Thanks,
  Neil
