o A simple "make" builds the program test1.
o "test1 <.exo mesh file>" reads the mesh file, writes it back out to a file
  of the same name with ".copy" appended, reads that mesh file in and compares
  the two meshes.  If they are identical "PASS" is printed. Otherwise, if they
  are different or if any other failure occurred, "FAIL" is printed.
o "make clean" removes all temporary or intermerdiate files; "make cleanest"
  removes test1 in addition.
o The .jou files are the Cubit journal files used to produce the .exo files.
