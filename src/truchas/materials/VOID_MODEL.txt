THE VOID MODEL

In the old-Truchas material model, void does not have a special representation.
Any material with a zero density is classified as void.  Variables exist in
fluid_data_module that give the list of void material indices, but these are
not universally used.  Moreover there is an implicit assumption, stated in
comments but not enforced, that at most one void material may exist.

In the new-Truchas material model we treat void as a special thing --
there is no phase or material system that represents void.  The material mesh
function is used to describe the distribution of material systems throughout
the mesh, using the material system ID to reference the system.  These IDs
have positive values.  By convention we use ID 0, an invalid material system
ID, to denote void {*}.  The property mesh function component simply ignores
0 IDs when evaluating the average property on a cell.  The effect is as if
the property had a zero value for void.

[*] We could have chosen not to record the presence of void at all, but this
would have required carrying info about the volume fraction of a material
system even in the case of a single system.  The presence and amount of void
would then be inferred from a deficit in the total volume fraction of the
material systems.  In the end it seemed simpler to explicitly record the
presence of void (and its volume fraction).
