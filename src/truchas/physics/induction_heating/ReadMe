The following files comprise the EM solver core:

MimeticDiscretization.F90 -- Provides the fundamental tools needed to
	implement mimetic FD schemes over tetrahedral meshes.
MeshSupport.F90 -- Provides mesh tools.

MaxwellEddy.F90 -- Maxwell solver in the low-frequency, eddy current regime.
SolutionHistory.F90 -- Provides a structure for maintaining solution history.
CGSolver.F90 -- Simple CG solver.
sparse_matrix.F90 -- Essential sparse matrix tools.

MaxwellBoundaryData.F90 -- Provides high-level tools for configuring the
	boundary condition data.  Works in conjunction with MaxwellEddy.


The following files provide general output tools:
data_explorer.F90 -- General tools for producing DX graphics files.
field_probes.F90 -- General tools for probing discrete fields in mimetic
	discretization schemes.
GeometricModeler.F90 -- Rudimentary geometric modeling tools; used to
	reconstruct boundary information on bare meshes.


Miscellaneous service tools:
kind_parameters.F90 -- Kind parameters.
system_io.F90 -- mainly a routine to get a free logical unit for I/O.
utilities.F90 -- mainly a routine to convert an integer to a string.


The following files provide C-style assert facilities for F90:
f90_assert.F90, f90_assert.fpp
