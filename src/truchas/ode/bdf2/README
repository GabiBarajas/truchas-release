A BDF2 ODE Integrator

BDF2 is a stiff ODE integrator based on the second-order, backward-difference
approximation of the derivative.  This code is adapted from an existing BDF2
integrator package I wrote in the mid-90's (pre-LANL days) and used in my
moving finite element codes.

This package is specifically targeted for use in subscale modelling within
Truchas; that is, models that require the numerical solution of independent
ODE systems on some (or all) cells within a single Truchas time step.  The
modelling of viscoplasticity is one such example.

Most ODE integration packages are designed for solving (very) large coupled
systems, where overhead cost is insignificant, and the effective solution of
sparse linear systems is central.  For the present application, the systems
are very small (1 to a few) unknowns, but we may have a great many such systems
being solved simultaneously (one per cell, e.g.), and the overhead cost can
be quite large if a standard package is used.  This package thus seeks to
minimize overhead, by sharing fixed 'read-only' data between multiple instances
of an integration procedure, and making optional other data, such as the
gathering of integration statistics.
