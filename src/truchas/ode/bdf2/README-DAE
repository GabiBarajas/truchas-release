A BDF2 DAE Integrator

BDF2-DAE is an integrator for stiff index-0 and index-1 differential-algebraic
equations (DAE) of the form f(t,u,u')=0, that uses a variable step-size,
second-order BDF method.  Fully implicit ODE systems are index-0 DAE.  The
local SOM for the heat equation gives rise to an index-1 system: here the
scalar face unknowns (Lagrange multipliers) are algebraically related to the
cell-centered unknowns, their time derivative does not appear in the system.

This code is adapted from an existing BDF2 integrator package I wrote in the
mid-90's (pre-LANL days) and used in my moving finite element codes.
