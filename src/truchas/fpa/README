Changes

o Dropped the pure attribute from the interface to the dummy
  procedure DP of FPA_CORRECTION.  The PGSLIB_GLOBAL_DOT_PRODUCT
  routine we intend to pass doesn't have this attribute.

o Modified the interface to FPA_CREATE to take the vector size
  as an argument in place of a sample vector from which the size
  would have been gleaned.
