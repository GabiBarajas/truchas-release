README

Telluride/Truchas requires Chaco to do domain decomposition on
unstructured meshes.  We are permitted to distribute Chaco, according
to the GNU Lesser Public License.  Further information about Chaco can
be obtained from Bruce Hendrickson at Sandia National Laboratories:

	http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~bahendr/partitioning.html
	bah@cs.sandia.gov

Here is what we include:
	Chaco-2.2.tar.gz	original Chaco source
	LICENSE			text of the Chaco license
	README			this file, description of what has changed
	chaco.tar.gz		modified Chaco source

Our modified source tar file contains only the source, and we have
slightly modified the Makefile, and main/user_params.c.

To build Chaco for Telluride from the tarfile, we strongly suggest you
use our modified copy of code/main/user_params.c (supplied).  It is
important that you at least set FREE_GRAPH to false.  If you free the
graph data structure from inside Chaco, you will corrupt your memory
pool.  We have also changed several other parameters to quiet the
output from Chaco.

The Truchas build system will take care of building Chaco from the
modified source for you.
