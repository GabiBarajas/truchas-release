	Compiling PGSLib
  $Id: README,v 1.5 2000/12/05 01:10:41 ferrell Exp $
   PGSLib version 3.3.0
======================================================================

To make the interface and the libraries:

0) You must use GNU Make (often called gmake).  

1) Make sure there is a build-options.xxx file in the install directory for your system.
   Check the README file in that directory for more information.  For
   some systems a default build-options.<OperatingSystem> file is chosen, 
   based on the operating system.  This may work for you.  In other
   cases you will want to make a new one for your build. The name of the file
   is not important, but it must be in the install directory.  For what follows,
   assume the name is build-options.xxx.  If you are using the
   default build-options file you can leave the BUILD_OPTIONS_FILE
   argument off of the command line.

> gmake BUILD_OPTIONS_FILE=build-options.xxx  package

To make only the F90 interface (the compiled module files)

> gmake BUILD_OPTIONS_FILE=build-options.xxx  pgslib-fe

To make only the parallel library

> gmake BUILD_OPTIONS_FILE=build-options.xxx  pgslib-par

To make  only the serial library (does not require mpi for building or
running)

> gmake BUILD_OPTIONS_FILE=build-options.xxx  pgslib-ser

To run the serial tests

> gmake BUILD_OPTIONS_FILE=build-options.xxx  serial-tests

To run the parallel tests, first check the parallel run command
in testing/run-parallel-test, and set it appropriately for your system.
Then

> gmake BUILD_OPTIONS_FILE=build-options.xxx  parallel-tests




***************
*** OPTIONS ***
***************

** DEBUGGING **
To build a version of the library with STABS for debugging, add
	DEBUG=yes 
to the gmake line.  The libraries built with this option on will have
_g appended to the file name, e.g. libpgslib-par_g.a and
libpgslib-ser_g.a.  The _g libraries print lots of information
while running.

** OPTIMIZING **
To build an optimized version of the library, add
	OPTIMIZE=yes
to the gmake line.  Note that DEBUG=yes and OPTIMIZE=yes are not
mutually exclusive.  You can modify the flags passed to the compilier
by modifying the install/compile.<arch> file.

You can also set the optimization flags by adding 
	OPTIMIZATION_FLAGS= <flags to use>
on the gmake line


** MPI_ROOT **

You must set MPI_ROOT and associated variables in build-options.xxx


======================================================================
	Installing PGSLib
======================================================================

The module files produced during compilation are placed in the
directory interface/include.  To compile files which use PGSLib 
you should install the module files in a standard location.  To
install the module files and the libraries:

> gmake INSTALL_ROOT=<root of location for installation> install

For instance, if you use /home/pgslib as the INSTALL_ROOT then the
compiled module files will be placed in /home/pgslib/include and the
libraries will be placed in /home/pgslib/lib.
