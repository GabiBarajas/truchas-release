simple_gap_4_g.txt was generated by exotxt from some long-lost exodus file.

simple_gap_4.exo is a reconstructed exodus file based on the .txt file.
Cubit was used to generate a template .exo file which was converted to a
text CDL file using ncdump.  Data was copied from the .txt file into
this CDL file, and ncgen was used to turn it into the .exo file.

Note that the .txt file has the coordinate data as x1, y1, z1, x2, ...
whereas ncgen/exodus needs it as x1, x2, ...; y1, y2, ...; z1, z2, ...
requiring a lot of editor work.
