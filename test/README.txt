For a source of possible additional tests please refer to the test problems
(in various states of "working") in the directory regression_tests/UNUSED
in either the current svn repository (exists in r132 but since deleted) or
in the preceding CVS repository archived at tf.lanl.gov under the Telluride
project.  Also see the tests/ subdirectory in the CVS repository for tests
from an even earlier testing system.  NNC, 10/22/2013.
