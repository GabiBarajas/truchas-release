We really only want to run this test in serial using the single-cell meshes
boxA.exo.save and boxB.exo.save and the 2-cell mesh boxAB.exo.save, but there
seems no way to prevent it running in parallel, and the partioner and/or
Truchas isn't able to handle such small meshes (segfaults).  So instead we're
using bigger meshes that work in parallel.
