To generate additional restart files during the restart testing phase I'd like you to use the RESTARTwriteStorageObject.py
file in this directory (rather than going through the postprocessor options).

Line 785 and beyond in RESTARTwriteStorageObject.py is the section where you can create the binary restart file. 
To do so:

1. At Line 795, specify a truchas XML output file (you'll note there are examples already here). You'll notice that 
I like all my output directories to be placed in the ../scripts/test_TBrookParse/samples directory. 
Its fine if you don't adhere to this rule, in which case I'd recommend you specifying the full path of the xml output file, i.e

filename = '/home/scummins/pub/fornc/test2_output/test2.TBrook.xml'

2. At Line 836 specify the path and name of the restart binary file (for my component tests I generally 
use the form testing.*restart.binary) where * is some specifier (i.e nnctest2).Again, I like to place the resulting 
binary file in the ../scripts/test_TBrookParse/samples directory. If you don't do this I'd recommend specifying the full path
of the restart binary file, i.e

fileout = '/home/scummins/pub/fornc/testing.nnctest2restart.binary'

3. Type

python RESTARTwriteStorageObject.py

to generate the binary restart file. 

4.Finally, line 826 is where I specify the timestep to generate the restart file from, 
itimeout = 0 (i.e creating a restart from the 0th outputted timestep). 
Feel free to change this (i.e itimeout=1 would mean you generate the restart file from the 1st outputted timestep etc).
